# Configure AutoScaling for AI Workloads

## Step 1. Enable AutoScaling

### Add Pod AutoScaling Annotations

> To be used in conjunction with workload annotationsï¼š[Create Workload](/guide/recipes/create-workload#add-pod-annotations)

```yaml
  # Enable vertical scaling
  tensor-fusion.ai/auto-resources: 'true'
  # Configure target resource, options: all|tflops|vram, if empty only provides recommendations
  tensor-fusion.ai/auto-scale-target-resource: all 
  # Enable horizontal scaling
  tensor-fusion.ai/auto-replicas: 'true'
```

### Detailed Configuration Using Workload Configuration File

* Vertical Scaling: Based on historical GPU resource usage data, the community VPA Histogram algorithm is employed.
The estimates generated by the VPA algorithm consist of Target, LowerBound, and UpperBound, corresponding by default to P90, P50, and P95 usage levels.
If the current resource usage falls outside the LowerBound and UpperBound range, a recommended value is generated.

>[!NOTE] Note: If enable is not set to true, or if targetResource is empty, only resource recommendations will be generated, and the recommended values will not be applied in practice.

* Cron Scaling: Based on standard cron expressions, scaling takes effect when `enable` is `true` and within the `start` and `end` time range. Outside this range, resources revert to the values specified when the workload was added. [Cron Expression Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)

```yaml
autoScalingConfig:
    # Vertical scaling configuration
    autoSetResources:
      # Enable/disable
      enable: true
      # Target resource
      targetResource: all
      # Tflops usage percentile that will be used as a base for tflops target recommendation. Default: 0.9
      targetTflopsPercentile: 0.9
      # Tflops usage percentile that will be used for the lower bound on tflops recommendation. Default: 0.5
      lowerBoundTflopsPercentile: 0.5
      # Tflops usage percentile that will be used for the upper bound on tflops recommendation. Default: 0.95
      upperBoundTflopsPercentile: 0.95

      targetVramPercentile: 0.9

      lowerBoundVramPercentile: 0.5

      upperBoundVramPercentile: 0.95

      requestMarginFraction: 0.15
      # The time interval used for computing the confidence multiplier for the lower and upper bound. Default: 24h
      confidenceInterval: 24h
    autoSetReplicas: {}
    # Cron-based scaling configuration
    cronScalingRules:
        # Enable/disable this rule
      - enable: True
        # Rule name
        name: "test"
        # Rule start time
        start: "0 0 * * Thu"
        # Rule end time
        end: "59 23 * * Thu"
        # Desired GPU resource 
        desiredResources:
          limits:
            tflops: "99"
            vram: 10Gi
          requests:
            tflops: "44"
            vram: 5Gi
```

## Step 2. Monitor Scaling Status

> The workload generates a corresponding `TensorFusionWorkload` resource object, and the fields in `Status` reflect the current scaling status in real time.

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    # Reason for GPU resource recommendation
    - lastTransitionTime: '2025-10-09T09:16:46Z'
      message: TFLOPS scaled up due to (1) below lower bound (2)
      reason: OutOfEstimatedBound
      status: 'True'
      type: RecommendationProvided
  # Current GPU resource recommendations
  recommendation:
    limits:
      tflops: '13'
      vram: 1Gi
    requests:
      tflops: '13'
      vram: 1Gi
  # Number of replicas with applied GPU resource recommendations
  appliedRecommendedReplicas: 3
  # Currently active cron scaling rule
  activeCronScalingRule: <...>
```
